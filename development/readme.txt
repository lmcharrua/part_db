This folder will not be included in the official releases!
So you should put all files for development here in this folder.
Please do not save files for development in other folders!


Use the file "tools.sh" for:
	- replace tabs with spaces
	- update the doxygen documentation
	- remove backup files (*~)
	- add new files to repository
	- commit code to google code
	- create update packages (not supported yet)

Use "./tools.sh --help" for more information.

Important: You have to run the script from this folder!
